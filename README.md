# Dynamic-Indoor-Navigation-During-Fire-Disasters-in-3D-Environments

• Developed a multi-objective dynamic trajectory-planning algorithm for agents that optimizes 3D environment variables such as 3D path congestion, distances during path planning.

   • Developed an Agent Based System (ABS) which, given the position of the evacuees (Agents) and fire breakout points, gives the path to the safest exit to all the evacuees. 
   
   • Consideration of the real time spatio-temporal variables such as spread of fire, speed of the evacuees, and accordingly updates path in dynamic environments. 
   
   • Developed a Level of Detail-4 (LOD4) 3D BIM model of the environment. Implemented the evacuation model in Blender.
